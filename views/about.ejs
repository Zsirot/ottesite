            <p>
                Dr. Otte grew up in western Michigan, the youngest of five children, he was born into a family of
                teachers
                and ministers. He graduated from Calvin College, a Dutch Christian Reformed college known for high
                academic
                standards. After graduating, Dr. Otte was accepted into one of the first doctoral clinical psychology
                programs (Psy.D. degree) certified by the American Psychology Association (APA). His focus in graduate
                school was on psychoanalytic and family systems theory with a particular interest in the theories of
                Carl
                Jung.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many members of Dr. Otte’s family suffered from the disease of addiction, so, naturally, this became a
                focus
                of his therapy. He has always had a private practice specializing in the treatment of depression,
                addiction,
                and Bipolar disorder. After 15 years of practice and several personal and family crisis, Dr. Otte began
                focusing on integrating spirituality in psychotherapy. This was a natural transition for him, given his
                family history and religious upbringing. However, he will tell you that spirituality is not synonymous
                with
                religion and that the introduction of spirituality into his therapeutic practice profoundly changed him
                as a
                therapist, and his clinical work.
            </p>
            <p>

                Besides his private practice, Dr. Otte has maintained part-time clinical work in various settings. He
                directed an Employee Assistance Program for Texaco in the 90’s, worked at Denver County Jail for several
                years in the early 2000s, and has worked in several area hospitals performing psychological evaluations.
                He
                currently works at Good Samaritan Medical Center half time conducting evaluations.
            </p>
            <p>

                Dr. Otte brings a warm, irreverent, and compassionate approach to therapy with clients. He will tell you
                that, even after 27 years, he still loves therapy and continues to learn from the people he works with.
                Additionally, for the majority of his clinical career, Dr. Otte has offered group psychotherapy
                alongside
                traditional, individual work. He continues to provide psychodynamic group therapy for those brave enough
                to
                embrace the challenging and powerful modality. Most of all, Dr. Otte is awed by the power of the human
                spirit and believes that all people, no matter how damaged, can, with a little willingness, be healed
                and
                live happy, productive, fulfilling, and healthy lives.

                                    is the acceptance of mystery; that there is
                                    an undefinable Power that is unseen and incomprehensible to the human mind, and
                                    this
                                    Power is completely present and active in daily life. Spirituality in
                                    psychotherapy
                                    means an acceptance that the Power we can’t understand – which I call love – is
                                    most
                                    present in relationships, therapy included.</p>

                                <p class="text-center">Depression talks to us and tells us that the negative ideas
                                    we
                                    carry about ourselves are true; they are our reality when we are depressed. Our
                                    thinking and core beliefs need to change, the shame and guilt we carry be
                                    transformed. And, again, this happens through a renewal of the spirit. As in all
                                    solid psychotherapy, this can be very painful and difficult. But people do get
                                    well.

                                    great paradox to the cure of addiction, it is only through acceptance,
                                    surrender,
                                    and love that we get well.
